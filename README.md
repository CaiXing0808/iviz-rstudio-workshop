## Workshop Overview

### Pre-workshop Work

First, please read and complete the [workshop installation steps](#install).

Second (optional), sign up for a [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) account. They offer free accounts (with limited course materials). I recommend, though **not** required at all, the paid account. They are the *best* hands-on resources for learning R, Python, SQL, and Git (yes, better than Udemy, Coursera, swirl, etc.). 

I recommend:

* [Introduction to the tidyverse](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-the-tidyverse)^
* [Building Web Applications in R with Shiny](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/building-web-applications-in-r-with-shiny)

^ first chapter is available in the free account; other material requires a pay account.

### Part 1: Intro to tidyverse and Shiny

We’ll introduce [**RStudio**](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/) along with [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/), a unified set of R packages for end-to-end data science. These packages include core data science workflow tools for data acquisition, processing and visualization. We’ll end with an introduction to [**Shiny**](http://shiny.rstudio.com/), an R package for building interactive web apps. Shiny apps are flexible web applications that can be embedded within web pages, dashboards, and [**RMarkdown**](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) output like presentations or notebooks.

**Home assignment**

Use the Russian Twitter Troll data set to create a shiny app that queries on the keyword. The app should output the plotly-ggplot2 time series chart from [01-russian-trolls.R](./day1/01-russian-trolls.R).

### Part 2: Shiny and htmlwidgets

We’ll dive deeper into Shiny apps and review basic architecture, layouts, and reactivity with hands-on examples. We’ll also introduce [**htmlwidgets**](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/) (e.g., plotly, r2d3, leaflet), simple R packages for producing HTML-based interactive visualizations that can be extended with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this part, we’ll explore basic exploratory data analysis visualizations (line, bar, scatterplots) as well as how to visualize important aspects of social media data like social networks, unstructured text, and geospatial data.

**Home assignment**

Use one of the three project data sets to develop your own Shiny app. 

### Part 3: Advanced Shiny

We’ll consider more advanced layout templates like [shinydashboard](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/) to provide professional looking dashboard templates. We’ll also explore advanced Shiny functionality including interactions, persistent storage, and deploying apps publicly on [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/).

## <a name="install"></a> Workshop Instructions:

For the purposes of the workshop, we'll be using RStudio Cloud. This will enable collaboration with other participants and facilitate the course materials.

To get started, sign up for a free account [https://rstudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) (no need if you already have an account). If you already have a [shinyapps.io](https://shinyapps.io) account, you can use those credentials instead.

Students will be emailed the location of the workshop workspace the day before the first workshop.

### Run R/RStudio Locally

Alternatively, it may be a good idea to install R and RStudio locally so you can have the materials for your long-term research/work purposes.

To install R/RStudio locally:

1. Download [R](http://archive.linux.duke.edu/cran/) and [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). 

2. Download this GitHub repo through the Clone or Download button (note, the repo will change over time).

If you have Git setup on your computer, you can clone the repo into your current directory.

```{bash}
git clone https://github.com/wesslen/iviz-rstudio-workshop.git
```

3. Open the file `project.Rproj` in RStudio. 

### Installing packages

After getting RStudio set up, it's easier if you install the R libraries first (first set take about 3.5 minutes on cloud, second take about 30 seconds).

Run the file `00-install-packages.R`.

It runs this code:

```{r}
packages <- c("tidyverse","plotly","shiny","leaflet","dygraphs","flexdashboard","ggridges","learnr",
              "xts","igraph","visNetwork","tidytext","collapsibleTree","shinydashboard")

install.packages(packages)

packages2 <- c("devtools","digest","htmltools","htmlwidgets", "jsonlite","Rcpp","rstudioapi","yaml")

install.packages(packages2)

# need ggplot2 for plotly
devtools::install_github('hadley/ggplot2')
devtools::install_github("rstudio/r2d3")
```

Please read if you run into R-relate problems.

### Tidyverse / Intro to R:

These resources are a best place to learn the basics. Traditionally, R was taught on the core (or "Base") R packages. More recently, tidyverse has become the modern approach to learning R.

I **highly** recommend the first book for anyone wanting to learn R (and applying Data Science).

#### R Markdown

[R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) is an example of [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming), i.e., code combined with plain language (as well as code output). The output can be an HTML, pdf, or even a Word document!

R Markdown can do nearly anything -- build a website, write a LaTeX paper for publication, even write a book! (For example, [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) is written in R Markdown. See the [GitHub](https://github.com/hadley/r4ds).)
